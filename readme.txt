To compile and run this application, first navigate to the hw1 directory, or whatever directory is the parent of src, scripts, docs, etc.

Then:

On Windows, execute the command: .\scripts\run_windows.cmd <path to javafx folder>
On Linux, execute the command: . ./scripts/run_linux.sh <path to javafx folder>

Both of these will compile and run the program. Note that if you choose to wait for an opponent to connect to you and nobody does, the application will hang and you will have to close it.

To generate javadoc:

On Windows, execute the command: .\scripts\javadoc_windows.cmd <path to javafx folder>
On Linux, execute the command: . ./scripts/javadoc_linux.sh <path to javafx folder>

Be sure to include the correct absolute path to your javafx folder.

To run unit tests with junit:

On Windows, execute the command: .\scripts\run_junit_windows.cmd <path to junit standalone jar>
On Linux, execute the command: . ./scripts/run_junit_linux.sh <path to junit standalone jar>

Be sure to include the correct absolute path to your junit standalone jar file. A log of the junit tests executing and passing
successfully can be found in src/test/resources/log.txt. A code coverage report generated by Eclipse can be found in src/test/resources/coverage.png.

For Linux, the . in front of the scripts is important. Don't forget it. 

To develop and test my solution I used Windows 11 and powershell commands.
